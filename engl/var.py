# Python Variables
# You do not need a variable type declaration, depending on the value it also gets the type

x = 28
y = "kostas"
z = 'k'
c,a = 5, 3 
r = t = 0

print(x)
print(y)
print(z)
print(c)
print(a)
print(r)
print(t)

print("Kostas " + z) # ATTENTION: text and variable must be of the same type
