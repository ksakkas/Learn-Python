# Python Dictionaries
# A dictionary is a collection which is unordered, changeable and indexed. 
# In Python dictionaries are written with curly brackets, and they have keys and values.
# You can access the items of a dictionary by referring to its key name, inside square brackets:

dit = {                                                          # Create a dictionary named dit
    "departmeny" : "Informatics and Telecommunications",         # Dictionary data
    "university" : "Ioannina"
}  

un = dit["university"]                                           # Item search
print(un)

print(dit)
